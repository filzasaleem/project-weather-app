# Weather App (week 3)

In the third week of the Technigo React/Redux skill-up course, the assignment involved crafting a weather app utilizing the OpenWeather API. The primary focus was on implementing the app using vanilla JavaScript and working on APIs.

## The Challange

The Weather App leverages two endpoints from the OpenWeather API:

### Weather Endpoint: This provides the current weather forecast.
### Forecast Endpoint: This offers a 5-day weather forecast.
By default, the app displays the weather for Uppsala, the creator's current city. However, it incorporates geolocation functionality, allowing users to obtain weather information based on their current location. The app also supports searching for weather conditions by city name.

Additionally, the Weather App displays accurate local sunrise and sunset times for the selected city. The app's background color dynamically changes based on temperature, and weather icons adapt to represent conditions such as rain, clouds, or sunshine. Moreover, the app is designed to be responsive across different devices

## Technologies used
1. Vanilla JavaScript, incorporating various functions.
2. API Fetch and Promises for data retrieval.
3. CSS for styling.

## Future work
While the Weather App showcases impressive functionality, there are areas for potential enhancement in the future:

### Loading Screen Background Color:
Currently, a default background color is displayed while the app is loading. Consider refining this aspect by opting for a more seamless and visually appealing transition, perhaps with no background color during the loading phase.

### Code Refactoring:
Continuously improve the codebase by refactoring it. This involves restructuring the code for better readability, maintainability, and adherence to best practices. Clear and concise code ensures easier collaboration and future updates.

By addressing these aspects, the Weather App can become even more user-friendly and maintainable.
